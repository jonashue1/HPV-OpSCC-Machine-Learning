Hue J, Valinciute Z, Thavaraj S, Veschini L. Multifactorial estimation of clinical outcome in HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma via automated image analysis of routine diagnostic H&E slides and neural network modelling. Oral Oncol. 2023 Jun;141:106399. doi: 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2023.106399. Epub 2023 Apr 23. PMID: 37098302.

Please see the paper published in Oral Oncology for more details on how the Haematoxylin & Eosin Profiling Tool (HEPT) was utilised to segment, classify and quantify various histopathological features from H&E biopsies of HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. 

The HEPT consists of various steps involving open-source image analysis software:
1. Pixel-level classifier in QuPath
2. Stardist implemented in ImageJ
3. CellProfiler & CellProfiler Analyst
